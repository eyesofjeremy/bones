Stylesheet: Main Stylesheet

Here's where the magic happens. Here, you'll see we are calling in
the separate media queries. The base mobile goes outside any query
and is called at the beginning, after that we call the rest
of the styles inside media queries.

******************************************************************/

// ==================
// IMPORTING PARTIALS
// These files are needed at the beginning so that we establish all
// our mixins, functions, and variables that we’ll be using across
// the whole project.
// ------------------

// normalize: http://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/
@import "partials/normalize";

// Sass variables
@import "partials/variables";

// typography
@import "partials/typography";

// Gutenberg palette colors
@import "palette";

// Sass functions
@import "partials/functions";

// import mixins
@import "partials/mixins";

// the grid
@import "partials/grid";

// ==================
// IMPORTING MODULES
// Modules are reusable blocks or elements we use throughout the project.
// We can break them up as much as we want or just keep them all in one.
// I mean, you can do whatever you want. The world is your oyster. Unless
// you hate oysters, then the world is your peanut butter & jelly sandwich.
// ------------------

// alert boxes
@import "modules/alerts";

// buttons
@import "modules/buttons";

// forms (inputs & labels)
@import "modules/forms";

// tabs
@import "modules/tabs";

// parallax - not working w/ multiply blend-mode
// @import "modules/parallax";


// ==================
// MEDIA QUERIES
// These are organized with em-based breakpoints. The breakpoints can be
// changed in _queries.scss, and perhaps even should be, depending on your 
// design. Rather than basing breakpoints on specific pixels, this approach 
// allows the design to relate to the actual content. If somebody enlarges 
// the page to read something, the design should adapt.
// The layout files are in, um, the layouts folder.
// Have fun!
// ------------------
@import "partials/queries";

// ==================
// PRINT STYLESHEET
// Feel free to customize this. Remember to add things that won’t make
// sense to print at the bottom. Things like nav, ads, and forms should
// be set to display none.
// ------------------
@media print {

	// styles in print.scss
	@import "partials/print";

}
